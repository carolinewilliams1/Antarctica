                    <span class="dateText">1773</span> Captain James Cook becomes the first recorded European navigator to cross the Antarctic Circle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <span class="dateText">1820</span> Antarctica is 'first sighted' by European explorers. The first person to actually see the Antarctic mainland has been debated: in the last week of January, Thaddeus von Bellingshausen reported seeing 'an ice shore of extreme height' during a Russian expedition to the Antarctic.
                    
                    Around the same time, Royal Navy officer Edward Bransfield reported seeing 'high mountains, covered with snow' during a British mapping expedition. Captain Cook's expedition 50 years previously never sighted land.

                 <p>
                    <span class="dateText">1823</span> Captain James Weddell sets a new record for the furthest south ever travelled by an Antarctic explorer. The Weddell Sea is named after him, as is the Weddell seal – the most southerly breeding land mammal in the world.
                    
                </p>
                 <p>
                    <span class="dateText">1831-32</span> Captain John Biscoe becomes the third person after Cook and Bellingshausen to circumnavigate Antarctica. During his expedition, he sights new areas of the continent including Enderby Land and Graham Land.
                </p>
                 <p>      
                    <span class="dateText">1839-41</span> James Clark Ross commands Erebus and Terror (the ships later to be lost during Franklin’s search for the North-West Passage) to the Antarctic. During the expedition, Ross discovers the Ross Sea and Ross Ice Shelf: this region would later serve as the starting point for both Amundsen and Scott’s expeditions to the South Pole in 1911.
                </p>    
                 <p>  
                    <span class="dateText">1898-99</span> The Belgian ship Belgica led by Adrien de Gerlache becomes the first vessel to spend a winter in the Antarctic after becoming trapped in ice for a year. Among the crew on the ship is Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen, later to become the first person to reach the South Pole.
                </p>    
                 <p>   
                    <span class="dateText">1899</span> Norwegian Carsten Borchgrevink leads the first British expedition in what would come to be known as the ‘Heroic Age' of Antarctic exploration. Borchgrevink's expedition is the first to spend a winter on the Antarctic mainland, and the first to use dogs and sledges on the continent.
                </p> 
                 <p>   
                    <span class="dateText">1901-1904</span> Captain Robert Falcon Scott leads his first expedition to the Antarctic in the specially built ship Discovery. 
                    
                    During the National Antarctic Expedition, Scott, Ernest Shackleton and EA Wilson travel to within 410 miles of the South Pole before they are forced to turn back on 30 December 1902. When they return to their base at the Discovery, the three men are described as ‘almost unrecognisable’, with ‘long beards, hair dirty, swollen lips & peeled complexions & blood-shot eyes’.
                </p>
                    
                 <p>
                    <span class="dateText">1907-1909</span> Ernest Shackleton leads the second British Antarctic Expedition on the Nimrod. On 9 January 1909, Shackleton, Frank Wild, Eric Marshall and Jameson Adams come within 97 miles of the South Pole, but the return trip almost costs them their lives. On 3 March, all four men finally arrive back at the Nimrod, after having initially been given up for dead by the men stationed on the ship.
                </p>   
                 <p>
                    <span class="dateText">1910</span> Robert Falcon Scott and Roald Amundsen both depart for Antarctica on their separate expeditions to reach the South Pole. Scott and his crew leave Cardiff on the Terra Nova on 15 June; Amundsen departs Kristiansand on 9 August on the Fram.
                    
                    Amundsen had originally planned to make a bid for the North Pole but changed his objective after two American explorers each claimed to have reached the goal. He only revealed his South Pole ambitions to his crew after he had set sail.
                    
                    Scott discovered that he was in a ‘race’ on 13 October after landing in Melbourne, Australia. Amundsen’s brother Leon had sent Scott a telegram, simply saying: ‘Beg leave to inform you Fram proceeding Antarctica. Amundsen.'
                </p>
                 <p>
                    <span class="dateText">1911</span> Amundsen sets out to reach the South Pole with five men, four sledges and 52 dogs, travelling to pre-prepared depots and killing dogs for food as they go. Seventeen of the original 52 dogs would make it to the Pole, and 12 made it back.
                </p>
                 <p>
                    <span class="dateText">1911</span> Scott’s main party sets out. The initial plan included the use of ponies, dogs and tractors to carry supplies, with only the final push to the Pole using manpower alone.
                    
                    However, setbacks and equipment failure meant that Scott would have to man-haul far further and on fewer provisions than he had originally planned.
                </p>    
                
                 <p>    
                    <span class="dateText">1914</span> Ernest Shackleton departs on the Endurance on his Trans-Antarctic Expedition, aiming to become the first to cross Antarctica from sea to sea via the South Pole.
                </p>
                 <p>    
                    <span class="dateText">1915</span> Endurance becomes stuck in the pack ice of the Weddell Sea. Shackleton hopes to spend the winter on board and wait for the ice to free them, but over the course of the next nine months the ship is gradually crushed. The crew finally abandon the ship on 27 October, and all 28 men are left stranded on the frozen sea.
                </p>
                 <p>
                    <span class="dateText">1916</span> Unable to remain on the sea ice any longer, the party abandon their ‘Ocean Camp’ in three lifeboats: the James Caird, the Dudley Docker and the Stancomb-Willis. The closest solid land, the uninhabited Elephant Island, is over 100 miles away, but all three boats reach their destination on 17 April.
                </p>
                 <p>
                    <span class="dateText">1916</span> Six men including Shackleton leave on the James Caird in search of rescue, planning to sail 800 miles to the whaling stations of South Georgia. The rest of the group remain on Elephant Island, using the upturned boats as shelter.
                    Shackleton and the rescue party finally reach South Georgia 17 days later but are forced to land on the uninhabited side of the island. The party treks without sleep across the unmapped island, finally reaching the Norwegian whaling station at Stromness on 20 May. It would take until 30 August before Shackleton could reach the rest of his men left on Elephant Island. All 28 men survived.
                </p>
                 <p>    
                    <span class="dateText">1914-17</span> While Shackleton and his men struggled to survive the loss of Endurance, the second half of the Trans-Antarctic Expedition faced their own challenges. The Ross Sea Party had been tasked with laying supply depots along the Antarctic route from the opposite side of the continent, which Shackleton planned to use during the final part of his expedition. However, their ship broke free, and the men left behind were not rescued until January 1917. While the depots were never used, the group managed to cover 1,356 miles across the ice laying supplies. Three men died during the expedition.

                    <span class="dateText">1922</span> Ernest Shackleton dies of a heart attack during an expedition to the Antarctic on board the Quest.

                 <p>    
                    <span class="dateText">1929</span> Expedition leader Richard Byrd, pilot Bernt Balchen, co-pilot Harold June and radio operator Ashley McKinley become the first people to fly over the South Pole.

                 <p>
                    <span class="dateText">1935</span> Danish Norwegian explorer Caroline Mikkelsen becomes the first woman to set foot on Antarctica.

                 <p>
                    <span class="dateText">1943</span> Britain launches the secret wartime mission Operation Tabarin, establishing permanent bases in the Antarctic for the first time. The resulting bases were later given over to scientific research and became the foundation for the British Antarctic Survey in 1962.
                </p>
                 <p>    
                    <span class="dateText">1958</span> The Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition led by Vivian Fuchs becomes the first to successfully cross the continent, travelling 2,158 miles in 99 days. Mount Everest climber Edmund Hillary leads part of the mission, laying supplies for the crossing party as far as the South Pole. In the process he leads just the third group to reach the South Pole, and the first to do so in vehicles.
                </p>
                 <p>    
                    <span class="dateText">1961</span> The Antarctic Treaty comes into force, an international agreement establishing how the continent should be protected and governed. Twelve countries – Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, South Africa, the Soviet Union, the UK and the USA – first signed the international treaty in 1959, declaring that Antarctica should be ‘a natural reserve, devoted to peace and science’.

                    <span class="dateText">1992-1993</span> Ranulph Fiennes and Dr Mike Stroud become the first people to cross the Antarctic continent unsupported, without assistance or extra supplies.
