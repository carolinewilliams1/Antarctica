            <h3>International Research Stations</h3>

            <p>    Regarded as the “international continent”, Antarctica is a place of worldwide cooperation, peace, and scientific discovery. There are currently 70 permanent research stations scattered across the continent of Antarctica, which represent 29 countries from every continent on Earth.  
            </p>
            <br>    
                <h3>United States Antarctic Program</h3>
            <p>    
                Without interruption since 1956, Americans have been studying the Antarctic and its interactions with the rest of the planet. These investigators and supporting personnel make up the U.S. Antarctic Program, which carries forward the Nation's goals of supporting the Antarctic Treaty, fostering cooperative research with other nations, protecting the Antarctic environment, and developing measures to ensure only equitable and wise use of resources. The program comprises research by scientists selected from universities and other research institutions and operations and support by a contractor and other agencies of the U.S. Government. The National Science Foundation (the U.S. Government agency that promotes the progress of science) funds and manages the program. Approximately, 3,000 Americans are involved each year.

                The research has three goals: 
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>to understand the region and its ecosystems</li>
                <li>to understand its effects on (and responses to) global processes such as climate</li>
                <li>to use the region as a platform to study the upper atmosphere and space</li>
            </ul>
            <br>    
            <p>
                The three U.S. year-round research stations are located on: 
            </p>

            <ul>    
                <li>Ross Island (McMurdo Station)</li>
                <li>Geographic South Pole (Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station)</li>
                <li>Anvers Island in the Antarctic Peninsula region (Palmer Station)</li>
            </ul>
